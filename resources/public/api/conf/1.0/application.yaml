    [Check the data you need to send](/guides/fraud-prevention/). You can also use the [Test API](/api-documentation/docs/api/service/txm-fph-validator-api/1.0) during initial development and as part of your quality assurance checks.

    # Versioning
    When an API changes in a way that is backwards-incompatible, we increase the version number of the API. 
    See our [reference guide](/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#versioning) for more on
    versioning.


    # Errors
    We use standard HTTP status codes to show whether an API request succeeded or not. They are usually in the range:

    - 200 to 299 if it succeeded, including code 202 if it was accepted by an API that needs to wait for further action
    - 400 to 499 if it failed because of a client error by your application
    - 500 to 599 if it failed because of an error on our server

    Errors specific to each API are shown in the Endpoints section, under Response. See our [reference guide](https://developer.service.hmrc.gov.uk/api-documentation/docs/reference-guide#errors) for more on errors.

    Single errors will be returned in the following format:<br>
    `{
        "code": "FORMAT_FIELD_NAME",
        "message": "The provided FieldName is invalid"
    }`

    Where possible, multiple errors will be returned with `INVALID_REQUEST` in the following format:<br>
    `{
        "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
        "message": "Invalid request",
        "errors": [
            {
                "code": "RULE_FIELD_NAME",
                "message": "The provided FieldName is not allowed"
            },
            {
                "code": "FORMAT_FIELD_NAME",
                "message": "The provided FieldName is invalid"
            }
        ]
    }`

    Where it is possible for the same error to be returned multiple times, `message` will describe the expected format and `paths` will show the fields which are invalid.<br>

    Where arrays are submitted a number indicates the object in the array sequence, for example, `/arrayName/1/fieldName`.

    An example with single error:<br>
    `{
        "code": "FORMAT_STRING_NAME",
        "message": "The provided field is not valid",
        "paths": [ "/arrayName/0/fieldName" ]
    }`

    An example with multiple errors:<br>
    `{
        "code": "INVALID_REQUEST",
        "message": "Invalid request",
        "errors": [
            {
               "code": "FORMAT_VALUE",
               "message": "The value should be between 0 and 99999999999.99",
               "paths": [ "/objectName/fieldName1", "/arrayName/0/fieldName2" ]
            },
            {
               "code": "FORMAT_STRING_NAME",
               "message": "The provided field is not valid",
               "paths": [ "/arrayName/0/fieldName3", "/arrayName/1/fieldName3" ]
            }
        ]
    }`

    # Testing
    You can use the sandbox environment to <a href="/api-documentation/docs/testing">test this API</a>. You can use the <a href="/api-documentation/docs/api/service/api-platform-test-user/1.0">Create Test User API</a> or it's frontend service to create test users.

    It may not be possible to test all scenarios in the sandbox. You can test some scenarios by passing the `Gov-Test-Scenario` header. Documentation for each endpoint includes a **Test data** section, which explains the scenarios that you can simulate using the `Gov-Test-Scenario` header.

    If you have a specific testing need that is not supported in the sandbox, contact <a href="/developer/support">our support team</a>.

    Some APIs may be marked \[test only\]. This means that they are not available for use in production and may change.
